**_Abstract:_**  _dpsFramework_ is a very low weight _integrated development environment_ (IDE) that is executed on JADE[^TILAB] multi-agent platform _agents_. This framework is oriented to allow _Java_ Language programming in _agents_ at runtime. With _dpsFramework_ it is possible to build complex behaviors and eliminate or incorporate these behaviors from agent task scheduler, without the need to close, re-compile and re-enter the agent on JADE  platform. _dpsFramework_ improves source-code debugging capacity because, it offers the main functionalities of an _integrated development environment_ and it includes functionalities to facilitate agent-oriented programming (AOP).
_dpsFramework_ also allows to run analysis processes; write _scripts_ to automate the repetition of tests; _dpsFramework_  facilitates the observation in real time of asynchronous phenomena generated by isolated behavior or, when this phenomena is generated by grouped behaviors in FIPA[^FIPA] protocols on a delayed and heterogeneous communication network. Beyond these capabilities, _dpsFramework_ is an excellent tool to teach and to study in depth the agent-oriented programming and, it has demonstrated how to distribute _rule-based expert systems_  using multi-agent technology.
