#### __Abstract:__

>  Development of Production Systems (<em>dpsFramework</em>) is an open Framework for building Applications based on Multiagent Systems. This Framework automates and facilitates your Agent Oriented Programming researches or developments using the <a href='http://jade.tilab.com/' target='blank'>JADE Platform</a>. This framework has been fully developed in  <a href='https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html' target='blank'>Java Language</a>. This Framework also offers an Agent class with runtime debug capabilities and two highly specialized Agent classes suitable for being plugged to Rule-Based Expert Systems implemented previously in <a href='http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/' target='blank'>CLIPS</a> or in <a href='https://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/' target='blank'>Jess</a>&nbsp;Languages. Those Agents are ready to accumulate knowledge, to integrate the reached inferences in its own behaviours and to collaborate  with the application's agents other.





**Contents:**   This website is storing the dpsFramework-software documentation, the behaviours programming applied techniques, some orchestration proposals with those behaviours, the Production Systems integration with Agents, the named Problem-Solver ontology, the management applied and ways to exploitate the Knowledge Base inside Agents, proceedings passed, working papers proposed, and so..
